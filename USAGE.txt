Required packages:
    os
    re
    math
    random
    basico
    dendropy
    warnings
    subprocess
    numpy
    pandas
    seaborn
    datetime
    copy - deepcopy
    matplotlib - pyplot

Required programs:
    1. COPASI GUI*
    2. COPASI SE
    both verion 4.42
    *The GUI version is required only for modifying the 
    COPASI file so it is not necessary to include in the same directory
    or even install on the computer where PEMPS is run.

Required files:
    1. COPASI (.cps) file containing metabolic 
    model that reaches steady-state.
    2. Newick or text (.nwk or .txt) file containing
    rooted phylogeny as Newick string.
    3. commands.txt file (described below)

All files and programs (except for COPASI GUI) must be 
saved in the same directory; 
this directory is also the destination for the output folder.

In COPASI GUI, the COPASI (.cps) file must be modified.
Steps 2 and 3 do not apply if BasiCO method is used.
    1. In the Steady-State Task, the "update model" and "executable"
    options must be checked.
    2. In the window opened by clicking on "Report" (bottom right),
    the options "Append" and "Confirm Overwrite" must be unchecked.
    Also, a text (.txt) file must be specified after "Filename".
    3. Save the .cps file.
These modifications ensure that the program updates initial parameters
based on mutations, that the SE version of COPASI can execute the 
Steady-State task via the command line, that the output file is
continually overwritten as opposed to being appended with new output
after each calculation of Steady-State, and that this output file
can be recognized by PEMPS. The user should click "Run" and then check
the Result section to verify that the selected model reaches steady 
state. If it doesn't, another model must be selected.

Note: if importing equilibrated root population, the output folder
must be in the same directory.

commands file
-------------
Whenever listing, use no spaces to separate list elements.
Leave no answer blank.

1. Enter file name of .nwk or .txt file containing Newick string.
    ex) canidaetree.nwk

2. Specify population size(s) as integers.
   If one number is entered, this will be the size of the population 
   of all branches. Otherwise, a number for each 
   branch in order must be entered. The order is the one in which
   nodes appear in the preliminary_branch_info file. To generate just 
   this file without any simulation, run the program with inputs of 
   0 and n to commands 8. and 12 respectively. Prepare an appropriate 
   list, and rerun the program.
    ex) 10000
    ex) 500,700,800,200

3. Enter population ploidy for phylogeny as an integer.
    ex) 1

4. Enter file name of COPASI (.cps) file containing metabolic model. 
Note: this file will be modified by the program, so to start another
 simulation, the user should reimport the model from BioModels and 
 resave as a .cps file. Saving a template file with the correct settings 
 adjustments is recommended.
    ex) Kerkhoven.cps

5. Enter names of reactions representing fluxes on which selective 
pressure operates.
    ex) pyruvate kinase [CDC19]

6. Enter weights (summing to 1) for each reaction flux specified above.
These values will determine how determinative each flux is to 
population fitness.
    ex) 1
    ex) 0.4,0.6

7. Enter parameters to be excluded from mutation.
    ex) Glco

8. Enter number of simulations to run as integer.

9. Enter integer of generations to equilibrate root population. If 0,
the program will automatically detect equilibration by finding when 
fitness and 80% of initial conditions and reaction fluxes reach certain
indicators of flatness when plotted over fixations.
If the user wishes to override the automatic equilibrium detector, 
or extend the equilibration for a previously simulated population,
any other integer can be entered.
    ex) 100000

10. Enter integer of generations to simulate along the longest line in
the phylogeny, with other generations numbers determined proportionally
for branches by their length. If 0, the program will automatically 
convert branch lengths from millions of years or substitutions per
site to generations (see methods in accompanying paper).
    ex) 250000

11. Enter foldername containing previously equilibrated model. The same 
equilibrated population can be further equilibrated and/or used as the 
starting point for any other phylogeny. Enter None to start
equilibrating from file in 4.
    ex) exp_updates_TEST_Kerkhoven_230523_18.01

12. Enter Y to equilibrate or n to go right to branching simulation.

13. Enter a note for the foldername containing program output.
    ex) updates TEST Kerkhoven

14. Enter the Steady-State output file name designated during the
modification of the COPASI file in COPASI GUI.
    ex) ssoutK.txt

15. Enter parameter names to be excluded from being categorized as
binding constants. The program searches for parameters containing a 'K'
in certain contexts among the kinetic parameters to 
identify binding constants.
    ex) kc

16. Enter any parameters to be included in the binding constant list
that may be missed by the automatic search.
    ex) parameter_3,parameter_97

17. Enter the type of branch length measurement used in the phylogeny as 
"subs per site" or "mya" (millions of years) or NA, in the
event that command 10 is not 0.
    ex) subs per site

18. Enter Y to implement Haldane's constraint or n to go without it.

19. Enter directory to COPASI SE.
    example windows: /mnt/c/Users/username/bio/copasi/bin/CopasiSE
    example mac: /Users/username/Downloads/PEMPS/CopasiSE
    if in same directory: CopasiSE.exe

20. Indicate use of BasiCO by entering Y or n. It is recommended to enter Y,
except for those models whose parameters are not accessible with this module.
In such cases, PEMPS will try BasiCO and notify the user if instead the alternate
strategy (regex update method and subprocess steady state commands) must be used.
